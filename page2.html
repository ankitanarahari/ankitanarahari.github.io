			<h1>My Most Favorite Ted Talk I've Found On Youtube</h1>
			<p>Malala Yousafzai, education activist, has inspired me so much as I have grown up to read about her experiences. She is so close to my age
			and has studied the same major as I am studying currently. She continues to inspire me daily and I remind myself to continue to value my 
			education as highly as she has, as I continue on my path towards law school. </p>
